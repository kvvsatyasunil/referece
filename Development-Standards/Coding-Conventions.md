## Code:
- **No hardcoded values!**
- **No console.log!**
- **No Props Drilling!** (details in: [Medium.com Article](https://medium.com/better-programming/props-drilling-in-react-12da084aaf51))
- Custom functions are pure or higher order functions!
- If possible resolve all warnings showing up in the terminal


## Files and Directory:
- Use kebab-case for custom files and folders, stick to the conventions by NestJs otherwise.
- Flat hierarchy

## DevOps (CI/CD)
- **Small PRs and draft first**

**PRs rules:**
- good title that includes the type of PR as below
- Good description - not default one
- good commit messages to understand what you did for each
- comments for complex parts of code that you want checked and tag a senior
- ticket connection in PR
- Draft PR for unfinished work at the end of the day (pls include comments and tags so that seniors can have more time to check before final PR)
