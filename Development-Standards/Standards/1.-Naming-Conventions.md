Declare variables with const and let instead of var.

Variable and function names should be full words, using camel case with a lowercase first letter. 

Names should be descriptive, but not excessively so. Exceptions are allowed for iterators, such as the use of i to represent the index in a loop.

**Use camel case:**


```
getObjectDetail: function() {}
const sFirstProperty = "abc";
let isConditionFulfilled = false;
```


**Instead of snake case:**


```
get_object_detail: function() {}
const first_property = "abc";
let is_condition_fulfilled = false;
```



- For Classes:
  - Names are case-sensitive, lowercase and uppercase are different.
  - Start class names with a capital letter, use PascalCase for names.
`class MyClassName {}`
- For Private:
  - Prefix any variable or function with _ to show intention for it to be private
`_myFunctionName: function() {}`


In the table below, you can find examples for proper variable names according to their type.
